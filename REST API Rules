Rules for API to be a REST API:

1. response should be same irrespective of request platform
2. routes should be on the basis of Nouns
3. http methods should be used for doing operations on these routes 
4. http methods should be verb type basis 
5. data should be alwyas in JSON format
6. API should be stateless (eg: if the same request is mad to the backend it should not save the previous state and handle it just separately withut knowing ehat respone oreviously t hand sent for the smae request)
